<div class="box-min-title3"><strong id="17">REWORK ANNOUNCEMENT by <a href="mailto:syrno@hikari3.ch">syrno</a> - 1/20/25 @ 5:50 AM (UTC) <a href="#17" style="float: right;">#</a></strong></div>

<div style="margin-left: 15px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px">
<p>First of all, I would like to wish you a belated happy new years. In the last news post from about six months ago, I said “I'm finally on break again soon, so I have a handful of stuff planned for the site in the coming months.” Unfortunately, I was pretty lazy during that break and pretty much got nothing new done on the site. Any sort of development around it had gone completely stagnant, and I want to apologize for not fulfilling any of the promises I made about updating the site. </p><br>
<p>Right after that, my Fall semester started and I got super busy with work (and procrastinating). Around the end of the semester, I had finally started working on my own imageboard software, Kōshi,  from scratch for hikari3. The main reason I wanted to start from scratch instead of forking LynxChan (which is what we’ve been using) is because I wanted to make some super significant changes to how the site worked, and I thought it’d just be easier for me to just start from scratch. Also I just thought it’d be a neat project to do to get some development experience (I have almost none outside of hikari3). Most of the features and way the site works should stay relatively the same on the user’s end. Following it's debut on hikari3, Kōshi will be come fully open source and available for contributions from the community to make it better, and forks/clones to use it in your own site and change it as you see fit.</p><br>
<p>Along with the rewrite comes new features, layouts, bug fixes, and some other stuff. I want it to be known that some of the currently known bugs on the current iteration of the site won’t be fixed until the new site, so be patient please. Obviously, with something completely new, there’s probably going to be tons of bugs that we’ll need to work out, but from what we have so far, it’s works pretty well (albeit with some shit code).</p><br>
<p>If you have any suggestions or feature requests for the new software, feel free to make a post in the new thread in <a href="/h3/">/h3/</a></p><br>

<p>It's been 1 year since the site went public and I'm glad to say that it's still running well!</p>
<p>I'm finally on break again soon, so I have a handful of stuff planned for the site in the coming months. I've been wanting to do them sooner but I've been very busy and it's hard for me to keep up. I'm grateful for the community the site has and I hope things go up from here. Here's to many more relaxing years.</p>

<div class="box-min-title3"><strong id="15">MORE UPDATES by <a href="mailto:syrno@hikari3.ch">syrno</a> - 12/21/23 @ 11:53 PM (UTC) <a href="#15" style="float: right;">#</a></strong></div>

<div style="margin-left: 15px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px">
<p>I've made a few changes to the site...</p><br>
<p>I've added a new drawing board:</p>
<a href="/i/">/i/ - Oekaki</a><br>
<p>The rules page has been updated to account for the new board, so make sure to read that first.</p>
<p>As you also may have noticed, /aca/ has been delisted. This is mainly because I wanted to add the oekaki board, but we would have too many boards (We already have quite a lot for a small community), and I feel like it's not worth keeping /aca/ up instead of the oekaki board, since I felt like /aca/ didn't really fit with the rest of the site (To me at least). However, I'll keep the board open for posts in the meantime until it gets locked, and if you want me to move any threads from /aca/ to other boards where it fits, tell me in <a href="/h3/">/h3/</a>.</p>

<div class="box-min-title3"><strong id="14">UPDATE by <a href="mailto:syrno@hikari3.ch">syrno</a> - 10/28/23 @ 5:17 AM (UTC) <a href="#14" style="float: right;">#</a></strong></div>

<div style="margin-left: 15px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px">
<p>Sorry I haven’t done much in the past month to improve the site, or make any new updates. I’ve been really busy with work, school, among other personal things. Fortunately though, I’ll have more free time soon, so I’d like to go over what’s new, and what’s coming.</p>
<p>First of all, the most noticeable change: The new sidebar. I’ve been aching for a while to change most of the navigation from the header to the sidebar. I’ve always preferred to use the frames layout, without a sidebar, the whole page feels empty for me. If you prefer to have no sidebar, you can remove it with the [<<] button in the navigation field. (It still comes back when you load a page, which I have to fix still)</p>
<p>You may have noticed other changes on the main pages that appeared. With the addition of the sidebar, some of the old pages did not fit well with it, so I updated most of the pages.
The rules and FAQ themselves have been updated as well so I recommend checking those out. (If something doesn't work/display correctly, clear your cache)</p>
<p>A list of other stuff I’ve changed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changed icons</li>
<li>New post stylings</li>
<li>"Ad" placement</li>
<li>Larger thumbnail size</li>
</ul>
<p>And lastly, I have added a new board:</p>
<p><a href="/f">/f/ - Flash</a></p>
<p>As always, if you have any questions, problems, complaints to share, post them in <a href="/h3">/h3/</a>. The site may go up and down during the next day since there's a few other stuff I have to fix on the server.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 15px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px">
<p>It has been 4 months since I made the site public. I usually like to give these news posts each month, but I skipped over August since there wasn’t much to say. I’ve been busy with uni and trying to land a new job, so moderation on my part gets difficult usually. Luckily I’ve had janitors and moderators keep up with the spam, so I give them a huge thanks. I would also like to thank the people in the IRC/Dicksword that report it, as well as the people that report it on the site.</p>
<p>I’ve had some new ideas regarding the front-end, board CSS, and maybe even new boards(?) that goes beyond typical discussion. I’m not too sure what will work and what won’t yet, so we’ll see.

If you’re interested in helping with the site’s development, message on the IRC/Dicksword, or email me. I am honestly pretty bad with web development <img src="/.static/emotes/laugh.gif" width="45">

Overall, I’m happy with the comfy community the site has. Thank you so much to everybody that contributes! <img src="/.static/emotes/happy.png" width="45">

<div class="box-min-title3"><strong id="12">NEW RULES by <a href="mailto:syrno@hikari3.ch">syrno</a> - 8/4/23 @ 3:26 AM (UTC) <a href="#12" style="float: right;">#</a></strong></div>

<div style="margin-left: 15px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px">
<p>It's not much different. I just condensed it a bit, tried to make it more clear. I still recommend reading it as a refresher.</p>
<p>Happy August friends.</p>

<div class="box-min-title3"><strong id="11">USER BOARD CREATION DISABLED by <a href="mailto:syrno@hikari3.ch">syrno</a> - 7/21/23 @ 8:22 PM (UTC) <a href="#10" style="float: right;">#</a></strong></div>

<div style="margin-left: 15px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px">
<p>As most of you know, we've had user board creation enabled. Starting soon now, we will no longer have this feature open. </p>

<s><p>BUT this does not mean we are getting rid of the idea. This just means that instead of boards being made by users directly, they will be requested instead. There will be a dedicated thread for board creation requests, where you will answer several questions about your requested board so that I know you will put proper effort into managing your board.</p></s>

<p>Why? Easier and better quality control. I don't want an abundance of boards with no posts. It would make the site feel empty.</p>

<p>I feel like this change would be better for our much smaller community.</p>

<p>As you may have noticed, /a/ and /jp/ were merged into one board, since both are on similar topics and fits better with our small user-base. Sorry if you liked this feature from before, but I feel like this would be more beneficial for a smaller community. </p>

<div style="margin-left: 15px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px">
<p>It has now been 2 months since the site went public. Not much else, but we have added a new "Popular Threads" section to the front page. I mainly added this to make it look a bit more lively. I slightly changed the emotes because I'm a dumb dumb and thought CSS was the only way I could make them show up on here. Now they display in proper HTML now. </p>

<p>Another subject I would like to touch on is possible new staff recruitment. Mainly new janitors, to clean up the pizza spam on the site. I would also like to have some people that are able to bring more eyes to the site and do more in terms of the site's publicity. I'm not able to do a whole lot in terms of that. I will probably open up a thread in <a href="/h3/">/h3/</a> about it soon.</p>

<p>Anyways, be sure to share the site whenever you can. The more activity on these boards, the better it'll be. If you have any more suggestions and such, post about it in <a href="/h3/">/h3/</a> or bring it up in IRC/Dicksword.</p>

<p>In our first 2 months, we have recieved over 1,630 posts! That's over a thousand more than we had a month ago. Thank you so much to everyone that has contributed to the board.</p>

<p>It's been about a month since the site first went public. That's cool, anyways. I updated stuff like the new emotes! They were sketched up by Kriem, then I attempted to put them into pixel art. Captcha's gonna go on and off depending on when I'm awake, and when the 2 janitors are available. So we're probably going to have applications for these opened eventually. Most of us are in the United States, so we'll need some people from overseas. The pizza spam bot situation is pretty bad, which is our reasoning for enabling every board to have captcha.</p>

<p>Another thing that'll probably happen soon is an IRC channel. I'll probably do it when we get more posters.</p>

<p>In our 1st month, we got 400 posts. I'm happy that people decided to post some cool stuff. As we hopefully grow, we can also keep it comfy here hopefully. If you would like to see more activity around here, be sure to share the site! Especially to other boards too, that helps.</p>

<p>Thanks! Be sure to reset your cache and browser for the updates to work (If needed!)</p>
